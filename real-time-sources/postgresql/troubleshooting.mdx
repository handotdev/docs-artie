## Performing major upgrades

To do this, you'll need to do the following:

1. Pause your Artie Deployment
2. Delete the replication slot
3. Perform the upgrade
4. Resume Artie Deployment

### Step #1 - Pausing Artie Deployment

You can do this by going to the Deployment overview and changing the status.

```
