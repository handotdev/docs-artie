## What is SSH Tunneling?

An SSH tunnel refers to a secured connection between a local machine and a remote server. SSH tunnels are a great and secure way to manage access to private resources within your VPC.

With Artie, it would look something like this:

### Step 1 - Creating a SSH tunnel

If you have one already, skip this step. However, if you don't - then make sure to create an EC2 or equivalent instance. Make sure this instance can connect to your database.

### Step 2 - Allowing Artie to connect

* Create a new SSH Tunnel from our dashboard
* Grab the public IP address and port

* Once the SSH tunnel is created, copy the public key and add it to your server

<Info>
You can create the SSH tunnel from [**Company Settings**](https://app.artie.com/settings) or under **Advanced Settings** when you edit a deployment!

```bash
# SSH into your instance

# (Optional) if you want to create a service account
sudo adduser -m artie
sudo su artie
mkdir ~/.ssh

# Add the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

exit
```
