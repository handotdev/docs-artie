title: Enabling BigQuery Time Partitioning
description: BigQuery Time Partitioning is a good way to reduce the number of bytes processed which lowers your bill and increases Artie Transfer's performance!

### What is a partitioned table?

A partitioned table is divided into segments, called partitions, that make it easier to manage and query your data. By dividing a large table into smaller partitions, you can improve query performance and control costs by reducing the number of bytes read by a query. You partition tables by specifying a partition column which is used to segment the table.

### Why should we use table partitions?

* Improve query performance by scanning a partition.
* When you exceed the [standard table quota](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#standard\_tables).
* Gain partition-level management features such as writing to or deleting partition(s) within a table.
* Reduce the number of bytes processed + reduce your BigQuery bill

<Info>
Note: A BigQuery table **can have up to 4000 partitions**. So, if you picked the daily granularity, you have enough partitions for up to 10.9 years worth of unique partitions!

## Turning on BigQuery Partitions

The steps are as follows:

1. Pause Artie Transfer deployment (this will only pause Artie Transfer, Debezium will still be running and capturing the changes).
2. Create the table with the right partitioning strategy (e.g. `leads_copy`)
3. Copy the main table into the new partitioned table&#x20;
4. Drop the old table (`leads`) and [rename](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/managing-tables#renaming-table) the new partitioned table. (`leads_copy`)
5. Within the Artie deployment page, update the table settings
6. Resume Artie Transfer
