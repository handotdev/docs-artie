## Finding your BigQuery settings

### Getting your project identifier

When you are in your GCP project, you can see your GCP project ID at the top of the navigation bar.

### Getting your default dataset

In order for Transfer to connect to BigQuery, we will need to specify a default dataset.&#x20;

<Info>
The default dataset is only meant to establish the initial connection with BigQuery. The actual dataset specified within `topicConfig` can be different from the default dataset!

### Retrieving your credentials

For best practice, create a separate service account for `Transfer` and download the keys by following [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) from Google!

### Best practices

* For large tables, consider turning on Time Partitioning ðŸ‘‰ [enabling-bigquery-time-partitioning.md](../tutorials/enabling-bigquery-time-partitioning.md "mention")
