title: Fixed IP Addresses
description: To ensure all of our services are able to connect to your data sources, please ensure you add Artie's IP addresses to your firewall's allowlist.

## How is Artie deployed?

We leverage a split plane architecture:

* Our control plane houses our API server.
* Our data plane performs the actual data transfer.

When you add IPs, please add both the **control plane** and your **data plane**. Need help? Check out [#which-data-plane-is-my-account-in](fixed-ip-addresses.md#which-data-plane-is-my-account-in "mention")

## Control Plane IP ranges (CIDR format)

52.200.253.111/32
52.44.73.206/32
44.217.73.84/32

## Questions

### Which data plane is my account in?

You can see which data plane you are in by going to [https://app.artie.com/settings](https://app.artie.com/settings) and see `Data Processing Location` under `Advanced Settings`.

### Why is there so many IPs?

We're sorry! When we first launched, we weren't able to secure a CIDR range. We have now worked this out with AWS and will be using CIDR ranges for the next data plane we set up.

### I am hosted in another region

Get in touch with us either through our Slack or email. We'll be happy to set up another region.
